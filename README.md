OLED Name Badge
===============

Motivated by the "build your own name tag" activity at the Make Hardware Innovation Workshop several years ago, I decided to craft something a little less spontaneous but more elaborate. Imagine the traditional "Hello, My Name Is..." badge redone on a comparably-sized circuit board using an Arduino, OLED display, and lithium-polymer battery.

The code cycles through a series of graphics animations and then displays my name, randomly showing the letters in a different shuffle sequence each time through.
